# Rethink the Ordinary

This is a WIP game originally planned for the Level Up Game Jam 2025. I had a busy week and couldn't participate, but I think the idea is kinda cool (to try not to be late for work and not die stupidly in the process), so I've decided to finish it anyway.

I'm sharing this repository mostly to show the code and the architecture of the game, so while I'm using third-party assets (3D models, animations, UI sprites, audio), those are not included here.

I'll probably update this README at some point with more info about the code.
